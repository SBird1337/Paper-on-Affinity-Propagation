# Remarks for the 2nd version

## Addressed things

 * As suggested in the reviews I ran a spellchecker once more, there were some very obvious typos
 * As suggested in the reviews I added a figure to further clearify the message-passing procedure. I decided to cite the original paper (Frey et al.) because their visualization is pretty self-explanatory and helped me to understand the topic myself.

## Structure

The paper can be found in `paper/se-scientific-affinity-paper.pdf`, a latexdiff version of the first drafted tag can be found in `paper/se-scientific-affinity-paper_v1_v2.pdf`
Some auxilary material that is used by latexmk to build the paper / presentation can be found in the respective subfolders if needed.
